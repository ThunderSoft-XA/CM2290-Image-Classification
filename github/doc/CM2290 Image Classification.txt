Hello everyone, now I show you is based on CM2290 image action recognition AI Demo. 

Image classification is a machine learning task that identifies the kinds of object of an image. The image classification model is trained on an image data set containing a unique set of classes, such as different colors or sizes. The model takes an image frame as input and outputs the probability that each class is represented in the image.

Both image classification models and image classification models use images as input to predict the probability that these images belong to predefined categories.
For example, a image motion-recognition model could be trained to recognize different color of a meachine keyborad , mouses of different brands and sizes of monitor. 
Below is the output of a image classification model on Android. All right, that's the end of the demo
